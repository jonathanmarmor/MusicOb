1.) MusicOb


normalize indents to 3 spaces
[simplified tests instead] put tests in a README file
[done] make paths in tests relative with os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)) trick
package for installation with setup.py
[done] delete templates folder
consolidate ob2ly somehow
[done] make main function command line access with argparse: -t to run tests, yaml → ly → pdf
consolidate into one module if possible
upload to google code, github, and/or pypi


notes:
- requires python 2.7, because of string format method and argparse
- requires PyYaml library
- dependent on lilypond
- for music formatting to look right requires two funky fonts to be installed (and registered with lilypond?)
- has only been tested on Mac OS X
- I acknowledge that this could use a whole lot more comments!


- notation.py is the main application and can be imported as a python library or used from the command line.
- ly2pdf.py is a standalone module for converting MusicOb LilyPond files into PDF that can also be used as a library or from the command line.
- ob2ly is pretty old and is a mess, but works well.  It handles the gory details of turning a MusicOb Piece into a LilyPond input file with all formatting configured for my publisher.


Attached is a score produced with this software, which was commissioned for the Dog Star Orchestra experimental music festival in Los Angeles last summer, and will be performed at a festival in London this June by the ensemble Apartmenthouse.  I can’t show you the software that composed the piece -- it’s a humongous mess that I never intended to show to anyone or reuse.






2.) Top 10 Songwriters
- Made in a few hours, specifically as a code sample to demonstrate my familiarity with basic programming concepts
- spent zero time on the front end, obviously
- not meant to be an interesting app or to have useful features.
- was writing quickly, so the way I’m dealing with the App Engine Datastore is a major kludge, just stuffing all the data as yaml into a text field.  If I had spent another couple hours on this I would have 


- I didn’t sign a non-disclosure agreement, but their API is not public, so please don’t show vevo.py to anyone or look too carefully


3.) Transcribe Melodies


A tiny proof of concept script for piping pitch and duration data from Echo Nest into the music analysis toolkit music21.
